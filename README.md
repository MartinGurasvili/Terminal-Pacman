<h1 >How To play </h1>

   - [ ] You have 3 lives
   - [ ] Colliding with the wall or ghost will make you lose a life and respawn
   - [ ] Collect 70 points to Win
   - [ ] The game updates the position every second - so pacman will move in the facing direction
   - [ ] Pressing enter will make the scene update instantly
   - [ ] When wanting to turn, input [W/A/S/D] and then press enter

<h1>How To Install </h1>
  The only thing required for this is for python to be installed, in the terminal write:
  
  

`python "dragTheFileHear"`

  *Note: This game can be run on defualt python using the other script provided, however this make the player and ghost not standout, making it harder to play.*
  
  *I would advise to play it the way it was intended by installing a neat plugin called termcolor, you can do this with the code below*
   
`pip install termcolor`
